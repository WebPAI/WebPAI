## Welcome to WebPAI üëã

WebPAI (<ins>Web</ins> Development <ins>P</ins>owered by <ins>AI</ins>) aims to build an AI platform for more reliable and practical automated webpage generation.

The rapid advancements in generative AI, particular multi-modal large language models, now excelling in multimodal understanding and code generation.
This progress introduces a new front-end development paradigm, where multimodal LLMs can automatically convert visual designs into GUI code implementations, facilitating the software product delivery process.

This project collects a set of research resources and releases open datasets for webpage generation studies.
